# PFWDataPrep
This code walks through how to prepare raw data from Project FeederWatch (PFW), a citizen science project run by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Birds Canada, for use in R. The code template established is derived from *Greig et al. (2017)* and *Maron et al. (In Review)*.

Referring to the [Project FeederWatch Data Dictionary](https://clo-pfw-prod.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/data/202306/FeederWatch_Data_Dictionary.xlsx) prior to using this code will help significantly in understanding both the steps and results of each step. Data for use in this code can be downloaded from https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/. More information about the dataset is available from this publication:
> Bonter, D. N., & Greig, E. I. (2021). *Over 30 years of standardized bird counts at supplementary feeding stations in North America: A citizen science data report for Project FeederWatch.* Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution.

A method of zero-filling alternative to the one provided in this code is available at https://github.com/engagement-center/Project-FeederWatch-Zerofilling-Taxonomic-Rollup-Public. It can be easily integrated into the work flow of our provided code if preferred. If that code is used, please be sure to give the appropriate credits and follow appropriate protocols as detailed within its `README` file. As always, please credit Birds Canada and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for establishing and managing Project FeederWatch, as well as the numerous contributors who have provided observations necessary to form its dataset.
